Outlining the state of programming languages for hardware design and to
announce the first workshop on languages, tools, and techniques for accelerator
design (co-located with ASPLOS): https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/latte21/

There has been a renewed interest in applying programming languages ideas to
enable productive hardware design: Spatial [PLDI 18], Aetherling [PLDI 20],
Dahlia [PLDI 20], Koika [PLDI 20], Calyx [ASPLOS 21], etc.
Building such domain specific languages is an exciting area with the potential
for a lot of innovationâ€”from the design of type systems down
to the interfaces for integrating hardware.
This area also has a lot of unsolved challenges that the PL community is
well positioned to solve: giving semantics to programs with physical
constraints, building verified compilation tools, and building new abstractions
that capture the complexity of design spaces for hardware accelerators.

I will provide a broad overview of space by drawing on published research as
well as ongoing industry efforts.

Previous writing for broad audiences:
- Compiling for the Reconfigurable Future: https://rachitnigam.com/post/reconf-future/
- I'm the first author for two of the aforementioned papers in the area (Dahlia and Calyx).

If possible, I would like the blog post to be cross-published with the SIGARCH
