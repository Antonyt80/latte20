Outlining the state of programming languages for hardware design and to
announce the first workshop on languages, tools, and techniques for accelerator
design (co-located with ASPLOS): https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/latte21/

There has been a renewed interest in applying programming languages ideas to
enable productive hardware design: Spatial [PLDI 18], Aetherling [PLDI 20],
Dahlia [PLDI 20], Koika [PLDI 20], Calyx [ASPLOS 21], etc.
Particular interest in using high-level programming models and enabling a
broader set programmers to rapidly design highly-specialized accelerators means
that this area is ripe for innovation in all parts of the stack: languages,
compilers, debugging tools, etc.

I will aim to provide a broad overview of space by drawing on published research
from programming languages and architecture conferences.
I have published two of the aforementioned papers in the area (Dahlia and Calyx).
