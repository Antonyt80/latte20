# LATTE: Languages, Tools, and Techniques for Accelerator Design

## Call for Participation

LATTE is a workshop on building new tools and techniques to enable widespread use of hardware accelerators. Hardware acceleration is a key part of combating the decline of chip scaling. State-of-the-art processes for designing such accelerators, however, remains a specialized task requiring years of specialized training and large upfront costs. The goal of LATTE is to proliferate research that democratizes the process of accelerator designâ€”instead of needing dozens of trained hardware engineers and months of upfront design, accelerators should be built by software engineers over a weekend. LATTE is a venue for discussion, debate, and brainstorming on all of these topics.

Enabling rapid accelerator design requires innovation across the computing stack: languages, runtimes, compilers, drivers, virtualization techniques, interconnect design, verification,testing, etc. Because of this, this workshop will accept position papers from a wide variety of topics including, but not limited to:

- Domain-specific languages for accelerator design
- Compilers for optimizing hardware designs
- Verification and testing techniques
- Experience reports on building large-scale accelerator generator systems
- Position papers on designing the infrastructure and workflow for tools
- Retrospectives on existing work on tools, languages, and techniques for accelerator design.
- Call for solutions to open challenges in the area

**TODO**: I like the idea of reviewed talks from WAX. Steal it?

### How to Participate

The primary goal of the workshop is to enable discussion. It will accept **2-page papers** on a given topic.
Each talk will be a given a 25 minute time slot and will follow [SNAPL][]'s discussion format.
Speakers will present for 17 minutes. 4 minutes will be reserved for "table discussion" where small breakout groups will discuss the paper and the remaining time will be used for Q&A.

The submitted papers will be discussed by a program committee of interdisciplinary experts working on both high-level (languages, compilers, drivers) and low-level (circuit optimization, interconnect design) problems in the area.

Papers should use [the formatting guidelines for SIGPLAN conferences][sigplanconf] (the `acmart` format with the `sigplan` two-column option) and not exceed 2 pages, excluding references. Review is single-blind, so please include authors' names on the submitted PDF.

Paper submission will is [via HotCRP][hotcrp].
The accepted papers will not be published in a proceeding.

#### Discussion Topics

The WAX program will feature a debate among the attendees. We need your help building a list of controversial topics to serve as grist for the discussion mill.

Please submit a sentence or two about an open problem, philosophical question, or other thought you'd like to see discussed at the workshop. You can submit as many of these as you like. We'll use these suggestions to set up a debate during the workshop.

Add your topic suggestions by editing [this wiki page][topics] on GitHub.
